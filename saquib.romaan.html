		<h2>Stranger to Study Buddies</h2>
		<p>Saquib and Roman met for the first time at Delhi airport, both excited to begin their journey as medical students at Astana Medical University. They quickly hit it off, sharing stories about their hometowns and their hopes for the future. As fate would have it, they were assigned to be roommates, which only deepened their bond.

			At the university, they were introduced to their Latin professor, Moldir Man. She was a brilliant teacher, guiding them through the complexities of the language with ease. Moldir quickly became a mentor to Saquib and Roman, always willing to offer advice and support.
			
			Despite their shared love for Latin and medicine, Saquib and Roman had their struggles in their second semester. The workload was heavier, and they found themselves studying late into the night. This led to a few disagreements and a little fight between them, but they always managed to work things out.
			
			Their friendship only grew stronger as they faced these challenges together. They supported each other through the tough times, offering words of encouragement and helping each other to stay focused. Through it all, Moldir remained a guiding presence, always there to offer guidance and support.
			
			As their second semester came to a close, Saquib and Roman looked back on their journey with pride. They had grown so much since their first meeting at the airport, and they knew that their bond would only continue to strengthen in the years to come. With Moldir's guidance and their friendship as their anchor, they felt ready to tackle whatever challenges lay ahead.
